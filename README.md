# Flask-CRUD-RAG-LLM

A comprehensive project integrating modern web development with advanced AI capabilities.

## Overview

This project serves as a robust template for building applications that combine traditional web functionalities with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Technology Stack

### 🚀 Backend: Flask
- A lightweight and flexible Python web framework.
- Handles API routing, user authentication, and core application logic.

### 💾 Database: CRUD Operations
- Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality.
- Efficient data management for storing user profiles, document metadata, and interaction history.

### 🔍 Knowledge Retrieval: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Enhances LLM responses by providing relevant context from private or specific datasets.
- Utilizes vector databases for high-speed semantic search.

### 🤖 Intelligence: LLM Integration
- Leverages Large Language Models to provide intelligent, context-aware responses.
- Capable of summarization, question-answering, and content generation.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Content**: Seamless interaction between real-time data and AI.
- **Contextual Accuracy**: Lowers hallucination rates using RAG.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to expand with more data and complex workflows.
